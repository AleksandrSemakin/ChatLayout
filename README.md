## About

`ChatLayout` is an alternative solution to [MessageKit](https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit). It uses custom 
`UICollectionViewLayout` to provide you full control over the presentation as well as all the tools available in 
`UICollectionView`. It supports dynamic cells and supplementary view sizes.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
